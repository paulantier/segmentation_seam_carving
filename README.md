# segmentation_seam_carving
Silly project adding object detection information to the energy map of a simple Seam Carving algorithm

This project aims to improve a na√Øve seam carving algorithm by adding semantic information in the energy map and not just frequency. It results in better conservation of meaningful objects in the "carved" (reduced) images.

To be perfecly honest, i also wanted a way to crush my cats' pictures in a better way than a usual seam carving method
